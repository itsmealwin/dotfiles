== FaultTolerance ==


    # Every (non-trivial) system contains fault
    # Internet is also a distributed system, why is my internet not unavailable 99.99% the time?
        # Well this is thanks to fault tolerance
    # The point is "How often are all computers available at the same time?"
    # Difference between fault, error and failure
        # Fault is the triggering event (external distribution)
        # Fault does not always lead to an error, e.g. floating point is faulty but since it is not used, it does not lead to an error
            # Crash fault: Suddently fails
            # Timing fault: Actions carried out too late
                # Important in certain situation: car brakes
            # Malicious fault: Process does something it is not supposed to do


    # Approaches against fault
        # Fault intolerance
            # Eliminate fault causes
            # Avoid faults itself
                # Extensive testing
                # Have reliable components
        # Fault tolerance
            # By redundancy in dimension of space and/or time
                # Masking fault tolerance: avoid failure if possible
                    # Needs if the consequences are intolerable (death, serious financial damage, etc.)
                    # Always based on redundancy
                    # E.g. stateless workers, triple modular redundancy (in airplanes)
                # Non-masking fault tolerance: temp failure is acceptable
                    # Fail-safe mode
                    # Traffic light control: when fault, all lights switch to red
                    # Mechanical stop signs for train: when fault, stop signs fall down to stop all traffic
