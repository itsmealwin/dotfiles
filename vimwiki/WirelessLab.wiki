    == * Security components: ==
        # Confidentiality
            # Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information
        # Integrity
            # Prevent unauthorized modification of information
        # Availability
            # Prevent unauthorized withholding of information

    == * WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) ==
        # Uses shared-secret (Root Key / Rk)
        # Shared secret between AP and clients
        # After association process, generate initialization vector (IV), combine with Rk and encrypt it
        # Since the IV is concatenated to the frame (unencrypted):
            # If we can infer some structure of the data-frame (such as IP-Header)
            # Then we can XOR it with the encrypted data in order to retrieve bits about the root-key
        # Fake-authentication -> retrieve key-stream
        # Even better -> just use ARP because the WEP has no replay-attack protection

    == * WPA ==
        # Authentication is performed actually after the OpenAuth-process
        # Uses various keys for encryption process:
            # Pairwise master key (PMK)
                # Derived from SSID + Passphrase (Wlan-password)
            # Pairwise transient key (PTK)
                # Derived from SNonce + Message Integrity Code
                # Used once for one session
            # Group transient key (GTK)
